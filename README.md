# nx
Just a simple preconfigured Hyprland setup, installer and packages included.  
Based off of the JaKooLit Hyprland dotfiles.

This is entirely made for Arch (or other distros that use pacman), and will not support other distros.  
If you attempt to run this script on another distro, it will fail to execute.

To use, you can clone this entire repository, and run the `install.sh` script in order to install nx.  
This will require an internet connection in order to work properly.
It is highly reccomended to install this onto a fresh installation of Arch, as it is less likely to cause installation issues.  
The installer will delete your entire `~/.config` folder upon installation, which may result in some stuff breaking.  

Please make sure to run the installer as `sudo` or root.
